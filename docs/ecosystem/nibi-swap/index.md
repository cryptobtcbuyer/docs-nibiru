# ðŸ’§ Nibi-Swap

Nibi-Swap â€” Nibiru's Spot DEX. Swap, LP, and earn boosted rewards for longer liquidity locks. {synopsis}

![](../../img/nibi-swap-banner.png)

Separate from Nibiruâ€™s perps product, Nibiru includes an automated liquidity protocol (AMM) for spot trading called Nibi-Swap. 

Nibi-Swap is autonomous, permissionless, and secure. It enables integrations with other dapps without the need for trusted intermediaries.

Nibi-Swap V1 has an architecture that supports two pool types:

1. [Stableswap Pools](./stableswap.md): Well-suited to facilitate capital efficient trades between tokens with a 1:1 target exchange rate. As the reserves of a stableswap pool become more imbalanced, the pool behaves more like a constant product pool.
2. [Constant Product Pools](./constant-product.md): This model provides liquidity for all possible prices of a token and all market movements. Well-suited to primary crypto markets, where users want to trade speculatively.

You can swap tokens or provide liquidity at [app.nibiru.fi](https://app.nibiru.fi).

<!-- 
What is a pool? 

An AMM pool represents a market of two or mote assets that have a value relative to each other. As one asset is swapped for the other, the relative price changes, creating a dynamic exchange rate.

How are pools created?
